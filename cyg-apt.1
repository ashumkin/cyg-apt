.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcyg\-apt\fR is a Cygwin package manager.

\fBcyg\-apt\fR allows you to install and remove packages on the command line, and conduct other package management operations.

.SH USAGE
.PP
Examples:
.PP
\fB$ cyg\-apt\fR install gdb
.PP
\fB$ cyg\-apt\fR remove gdb
.PP
\fB$ cyg\-apt\fR list

.SH COMMANDS
.PP
setup
.RS 4
setup
is run automatically when \fBcyg\-apt\fR is installed. If for any reason you wish to reset your ~/.cyg-apt configuration file, you can delete it and run setup manually. The configuration information therein is taken from your last Cygwin setup.exe run.
.RE
.PP
install
.RS 4
install
is followed by one or more packages to install or upgrade. If the package is not present, it is downloaded and installed. If there is a newer version of an existing package, it will be upgraded. If there are required packages that are not installed, these packages will be installed in a fully recursive manner.
.RE
.PP
remove
.RS 4
remove
is followed by one or more packages to remove. The given packages are uninstalled from the system, but remain in the package cache. If you reinstall a removed package it will be taken from the cache unless a newer version exists on the server. Packages that the given package depend on are not removed. To completely remove a package use the purge command.
.RE
.PP
purge
.RS 4
purge
is followed by one or more packages to uninstall and completely clear from the system. Given packages are uninstalled and removed from the package cache.
.RE
.PP
upgrade
.RS 4
upgrade
all the installed packages \fBcyg\-apt\fR can handle. Use with caution. There are small number of packages \fBcyg\-apt\fR cannot install, see LIMITATIONS.
.RE
.PP
list
.RS 4
list
the installed packages, their versions and newer versions if available.
.RE
.PP
new
.RS 4
new
shows upgradable packages available on the Cygwin mirror.
.RE
.PP
filelist
.RS 4
filelist
is followed by a package to investigate: the files the package installs are listed.
.RE
.PP
find
.RS 4
find
is followed by a file to locate the package for: the package the file belongs to will be printed, if it can be found. This works for files installed directly from a tarball, but not for files created after the package is installed or by a postinstall script.
.RE
.PP
search
.RS 4
search
is followed by a package name to find. A partial name can be given: "term" will match "terminfo" and "termcap". With the --regexp flag a regular expression search will be conducted.
.RE
.PP
source
.RS 4
source
downloads the source release of a package, if available. The source is downloaded to the current directory in a directory named by concatenating the package name and its version. The Cygwin patching process is not currently automated by \fBcyg\-apt\fR.
.RE
.PP
requires
.RS 4
requires
lists the required packages for a given package.
.RE
.PP
download
.RS 4
download
a given package to the package cache but do not install it.
.RE
.PP
show
.RS 4
show
the information for a package, as found in the setup.ini database.
.RE
.PP
ball
.RS 4
ball
shows the path to the tarball for the given package.
.RE
.PP
url
.RS 4
url
shows the URL for a given package's tarball.
.RE
.PP
version
.RS 4
version
shows the installed version of a given package.
.RE
.PP
md5
.RS 4
md5
checks the md5 checksum of a package in the cache against the expected md5 given in the setup.ini database.
.RE

.SH CONFIGURATION: .cyg-apt
cyg-apt is designed to be configured by this file alone. The syntax of the file is straightforward and there are additional comments to help you edit the file. The file lives in your home directory. If you have need of additional configurations, you can copy the file and place it in the current directory: .cyg-apt in the current working directory is taken as the configuration over ~/.cyg-apt.

The key fields of .cyg-apt are:
ROOT
The path to your Cygwin installation.
mirror
URL of your Cygwin mirror:
cache
The path to your package cache.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
\fBcyg\-apt\fR, running within Cygwin, cannot alter packages it itself depends on: python cygwin base-cygwin coreutils bash zlib libreadline gpg. It is possible to run cyg-apt in and Windows command shell, but a more convenient workaround is to use the standard setup.exe installer to update these packages.

.SH SECURITY
\fBcyg\-apt\fR follows setup.exe in verifying downloaded setup.ini files using Cygwin's public key. This verification is performing using the Cygwin port of gpg package. This provides some assurance that the mirror is not providing malware versions of Cygwin packages, since any changes to setup.ini such as changes to package md5sum values will cause the signature not to match the file. An attacker able to edit cyg-apt or replace gpg with their own package can subvert this protection.
