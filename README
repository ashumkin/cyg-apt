This is the source for building and testing the cyg-apt package manager.

Being a standalone script, cyg-apt doesn't require building as such: the build creates the cyg-apt Cygwin package:


The bulk of the source in this release is for the test harness.

=============
Edit configure.sh to provide the URL of a scp accessable web server.
$ configure.sh
Configures the environment for building the test packages.

Makefile
========
$ make
