This is the source for building and testing cyg-apt.

ChangeLog:
Original subversion changelog.


COMPATABILITY NOTE:
As it stands this source is aimed at Cygwin 1.7 compatibility though the
differences to 1.5 are not great:
setup.ini is setup-2.ini
If .apt-get not available and no cmd line overide: default mirror is pulled from /etc/setup.rc if available.
If .apg-get not available and no cmd line overide: default cache is pulled from /etc/setup.rc if available.


README:
======
This fille

cyg-apt:
========
The standalone application Python script (does have dependencies on wget and tar utilities, but no other scripts.) As such it doesn't have to be built. This might change if cyg-apt ever becomes a proper package itself.

mini_mirror:
============
Supports testing: allows you to build and deploy a test package to a remote directory. The mini_mirror has dependencies on a set of Python utilities, See the README in that directory for more details.

As a side note, since the mini_mirror includes (very crude) system for building a package it might be of some interest as a starting point if you need to automate building of a another package. 

misc
====
Various noncritial development files that don't belong anywhere else.

test-cyg-apt.py
===============
Tests a subset of cyg-apt's functionality for regression. Currently depends on the presence of remotely installed test package.

See this file for a list of the functionality covered. While it is a bit of a pain to get this script working I recommend its use since 1) it will flag regression during development when run and 2) since cyg-apt is an (unoffical) installer/uninstaller it is quite important that it doesn't do the wrong thing to people's Cygwin installs.

dot_cyg_apt_template
====================
test-cyg-apt.py depends on a custom .cyg-apt being present in this directory to direct cyg-apt to the location of the package built by mini_mirror. This file is an example.
