This is the source for building and testing the cyg-apt package manager.
Note that the most recent cyg-apt source is available by anonymous subverison check out:
http://code.google.com/p/cyg-apt/source/checkout

Build requirements: cygwin, coreutils, python, tar, gnupg.
Being a standalone script, cyg-apt doesn't require compilation: "make" creates the cyg-apt Cygwin package, making a tarball from the script, manpage and postinstall script.

BUILDING:
$ make

The bulk of the source in this release supports testing cyg-apt.

INSTALLATION:
$ make install

configure
=============
Configures the environment for building the test packages.
Edit configure.sh to provide the URL of a scp accessable web server.
$ configure.sh


Makefile
========
$ make
Builds the package under build/release-2/cyg-apt/

$ make testpackages
